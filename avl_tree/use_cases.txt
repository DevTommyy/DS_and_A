PROS:
It avoids the case linear complexity runtimes for its operations thanks to its self
balancing mechanics

CONS:
The AVL tree may have slightly higher overhead due to the need for balancing operations,
which can impact performance in certain scenarios.

MORE:
The AVL tree is a sophisticated self balancing tree.
The AVL tree guarantees via the enforcement of balancing algorithms that the
left and right subtrees differ in height by at most 1 which yields at most a
logarithmic runtime complexity

WHEN TO USE:
AVL trees are ideal when you require fast operations (insertion, deletion, lookup) on
dynamic ordered data, especially when the data is frequently modified and needs to
maintain balance.
