PROS:
In both the insertion and deletion a heap maintains its order
according to the selected ordering strategy (that can be min heap or max heap).
The run time complexities of those algorithms is `O(log n)`

CONS:
The cost of maintaining the strategy still come at a price.
We will also have to factor in the cost of dynamic array expansion at some stage.
This will occur if the number of items within the heap outgrows the space allocated
in the heapâ€™s backing array.

MORE:
When you come across a heap and you are not told what strategy
it enforces you should assume that it uses the min-heap strategy.
If the heap can be configured otherwise, this will often require you to state that explicitly.

WHEN TO USE:
Heaps are most commonly used to implement priority queues and to facilitate heap sort.
